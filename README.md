# Video-Segmintation 
  - First we want to apply edge detection and smoothing filters to the frame We will use the Gaussian Laplacian filter for edge detection and Gaussian filter for smoothing.
  - apply adaptive thresholding to the frame to segment the objs from the background.
  - Apply morphological operations to improve the segmentation (eirosion and dilation) for edge linking operation too , we apply closing operation to fill the holes in the objects and opening to separate objs.
## if you want text only 
  - Apply tesseract OCR to detect the text in the frame
  - Draw bounding boxes around the detected text and apply last steps for segment text captions only 
  - Display the frame with the bounding boxes

# The base of Segmintation:
  - The base of segmentation is Thresholding after preprocessing frame and apply edge or regon or obj detection filter in Image processing  or algorithm like Deeplearning and ML algorithms .
  - there are many techniques of Thresholding like binary thresh hold  or variable or adaptive thresholding
  - could say that adaptive and variable threshold has same purpose or same technique
